[Kids] WordWorld!

[Pig, Sheep]
Welcome to the place
Where words come alive

[Kid] Let's build a word!
[Kids] WordWorld!
[Kid] WordWorld!

[Kids] Jump to the beat
[Duck] Clap your hands in the air
[Kids] Let's build a word! WordWorld!
[Kid] WordWorld!

[Pig, Sheep]
We've got friends of every size
Building words before our eyes
Nothing's better than a letter
[Bug, Pig, Sheep] They hold our world together

[Ant] With Dog
[Duck] And Duck
[Pig] And Pig
[Sheep] And Sheep, there's always a surprise!

[Kids] WordWorld!
